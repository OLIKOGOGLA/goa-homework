<h4>The Diary of a Stupid boy</h4>
<p>Greg Heffley is having a big year. He is the main suspect in vandalism - they accuse him of damaging the walls of the school. But he is innocent... almost innocent.
    The police also get involved in the case, and the heartbroken boy Tsripa watches who is knocking on the door of the house. However, he can't go anywhere from home, because suddenly a storm and heavy snowfall hit him.
    Greg knows he'll be held accountable whether the snow melts or not, but what punishment is worse than being locked up at home with his family for the holidays?</p>
