   <em></p>In order to find perseverance and courage in yourself, it is not necessary to present yourself. 
    On the contrary, for this we should be able to correct our defects and shortcomings. 
    It is on such ideas that the book, "The Fine Art of Hanging on Your Feet" by Mark Manson, is built.
     It teaches us: 1. How to face the challenges in the world? 2.
     How to know ourselves after overcoming difficulties? 3. <br>
     How to adapt to the idea that not everything in this country is the way we imagine it.</p></em>
